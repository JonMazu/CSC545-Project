        Main points to gather:
            - In the videos she did create a Swing GUI. I think this implies a need 
                for one as terrible as that sounds. 
            - What all do we want to give the user access to in this GUI?
            - How are we wanting to divy up work? 
                    
                    Emphasis on this. Still a team project. This is simple but needs to be split evenly.
                    *** EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO EXPLAIN WITHIN THIS CODE ***
        
        
            - Search for redudancy and compare SQL Tables to created forms (Part 1 and 2). Ensure consistency.
